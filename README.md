In this repo, I am going to simulate the google home page. Please don't blame me for copying - this is for educational
purpose alone.

I following http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

My Objectives:
1) Re create google home page with html and css
2) create the form and imput text button etx
3) Button not funtioning will not be issue now
4) Put all my files in github and sync with local repo.
